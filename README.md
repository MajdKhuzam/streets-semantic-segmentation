<h2>Abstract</h2>

This study investigates the suitability of the U-Net architecture, known for its efficiency in feature extraction, for the semantic segmentation task.
The project aims to develop a U-Net based street segmentation system, including image preprocessing, implementation of a custom U-Net architecture and training it with appropriate loss functions. The effectiveness of the model will be evaluated on a separate test dataset using the specified metrics.
This network relies on a unique structural architecture that allows it to retain fine-grained spatial information during the feature extraction process. This is done by merging feature maps extracted from deep layers with feature maps extracted from shallow layers, resulting in improved segmentation accuracy.
This project contributes to understanding the street scene by demonstrating the effectiveness of U-Net in street segmentation and paving the way for further research in this field.
